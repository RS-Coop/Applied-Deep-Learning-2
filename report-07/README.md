# Biweekly Report 07 - Cooper Simpson

## Report Plan
1. RL Fundamentals:
  Work through, describe, and discuss a number of core RL ideas.

2. Investigate RL Environments:
  Using OpenAI Gym to examine a number of RL environments.

3. RL with Discrete Lunar Lander:
  Examine a number of RL algorithms in the context of the discrete Lunar Lander environment.

## Goals and Results
The goal of this report is to get a more solid understanding of RL in general and some experience working with it in a deep learning environment.

## Repository Structure
- *RL Fundamentals.ipynb*: Follows task 1
- *RL Environments.ipynb*: Follows task 2
- *Discrete Lunar Lander.ipynb*: Follows task 3
  - NOTE: You will need to rerun this notebook to view all the videos because I accidentally overwrote them, but I think the current video should be C51 which performs well.
